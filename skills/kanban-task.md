## Overview

Creates and updates cards in the Hermes kanban board (`hermes kanban`). Every agent action that moves work forward must call this skill — the kanban is the source of truth the CTO reads via `hermes kanban watch`.

## When to Use

- A GitHub issue is accepted into the CTO loop.
- An agent starts work, creates a PR, passes review, deploys, or gets blocked.
- The founder needs current task state visible in the live board.

## Prerequisites

- Hermes v0.13+ for heartbeat and zombie recovery behavior.
- Kanban initialized with `hermes kanban init`.
- A concrete task title and verifiable acceptance criteria.
- A target assignee profile such as `pm`, `dev`, `security`, `qa`, or `ops`.

## Kanban columns

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Triage | Raw idea or unclear issue, not ready for implementation |
| Todo | Defined work waiting on dependencies or assignment |
| Ready | Assigned work waiting for the dispatcher to spawn the worker |
| Running | Worker profile is actively handling the task |
| Blocked | Worker needs human input or the retry circuit breaker tripped |
| Done | Completed with summary and handoff metadata |

## Procedure

**Create a new task (PM Agent, after triaging an issue):**
```bash
hermes kanban create "Fix: [what] — Issue #[n]" \
  --assignee dev \
  --priority [score] \
  --body "Why: [one sentence]. Acceptance: [verifiable checks]."
```
Or via agent toolset (preferred inside a skill):
```
kanban_create title="Fix: [what]" assignee="dev" body="Issue #[n] | Why: [one sentence] | Acceptance: [verifiable check, e.g. 'GET /api/health returns 200 AND existing tests pass']"
```

Acceptance criteria must be a concrete, verifiable check — not "it works." If you cannot write a specific check, ask for clarification before creating the card.

Save returned task ID to Hermes memory: key `task-id-issue-[n]`.

**Claim and move to running (Dev Agent):**
```bash
hermes kanban claim [task-id]
hermes kanban comment [task-id] "Dev Agent started at [time]. Engine: [hermes/claude-code/codex]"
```

For long-running work, the worker should call `kanban_heartbeat(note="...")` every few minutes. If a worker crashes or stops heartbeating, Hermes reclaims the task and returns it to `ready` for retry.

**Hand off to security review (Dev Agent, after PR created):**
```bash
hermes kanban complete [task-id] \
  --summary "PR #[number] created: [url]. Implementation ready for security review." \
  --metadata '{"pr_number":"[number]","pr_url":"[url]","next_assignee":"security"}'
```
Then create or assign the next review task to Security Agent.

**Record review passed (QA Agent, after review passes):**
```bash
hermes kanban comment [task-id] "QA passed. Preview healthy. Approval sent to founder at [time]."
```

**Complete (Ops Agent, after merge + healthy deploy):**
```bash
hermes kanban complete [task-id]
hermes kanban comment [task-id] "Merged PR #[n]. Production healthy at [time]."
```

**Block (any agent, when stalled):**
```bash
hermes kanban block [task-id]
hermes kanban comment [task-id] "Blocked: [what is blocking and since when]"
```
Then load `send-notification` — CTO Agent is alerted immediately.

## Quick reference

| Agent | Action | Command |
|---|---|---|
| PM | Issue triaged | `kanban_create(..., assignee="dev")` |
| Dev | Starting work | `hermes kanban claim [id]` |
| Dev | Long-running work | `kanban_heartbeat(note="...")` |
| Dev | PR created | `hermes kanban complete [id] --summary ... --metadata ...` |
| QA | Review passed | `kanban_comment [id] "QA passed..."` |
| Ops | Deployed healthy | `hermes kanban complete [id]` |
| Any | Cannot proceed | `hermes kanban block [id]` |

## Zombie recovery (v0.13+)

If a Dev Agent crashes mid-task, Hermes detects the missed heartbeat and moves the card back to `ready` automatically. The next worker that claims it gets the prior run history and can continue from the handoff context. No manual intervention is needed unless the card repeatedly blocks or the spawn circuit breaker gives up.

## Live monitoring

To watch the board in real time:
```bash
hermes kanban watch    # live dashboard
hermes kanban list     # snapshot
hermes kanban stats    # summary counts
```

## Pitfalls

- Save the task ID to memory immediately after `kanban_create` — without it you cannot update or link the card later.
- Do not skip this skill. The kanban is how the CTO monitors the loop.
- `hermes kanban complete` is final. For partial progress, use `kanban_comment` to log state.
- Blocked cards are auto-surfaced in `hermes kanban watch`. Always add a comment explaining what is blocking before blocking the card.
- Worker profiles should prefer `kanban_*` tool calls over shelling out to `hermes kanban` when the dispatcher spawned them.

## Verification

`hermes kanban list` shows the card in the correct state with an accurate comment thread.
