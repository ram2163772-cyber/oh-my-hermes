# Changelog

## 1.4.0 — 2026-05-09

### Added — CTO setup script and README corrections

**scripts/setup-cto.sh** (new)
- Creates real Hermes profiles (`hermes profile create cto/pm/dev/qa/ops`)
- Injects agent role definitions into `~/.hermes/profiles/$agent/agent-role.md`
- Initializes the Hermes kanban board (`hermes kanban init`)
- Authenticates `gh` CLI headlessly: `echo "$GITHUB_TOKEN" | gh auth login --with-token`
- Warns prominently if a gateway is already running (duplicate gateway = message conflicts)
- Saves `github-repo` and `github-username` to Hermes memory via `hermes chat -q`
- Sets up 3 cron jobs: hourly triage, 15-min health check, 9am status report
- Idempotent — safe to re-run; prints Pass/Warn/Fail summary

**docs/setup-guide.md**
- Added Step 5b: explains `setup-cto.sh` and its env var requirements

**README.md**
- Fixed stale "18 skills" count to "20 skills" in two locations
- Added "Configure the CTO loop" install step referencing `setup-cto.sh`

**scripts/verify.sh**
- Now checks that `setup-cto.sh` exists alongside `bootstrap.sh` and `verify.sh`

## 1.3.0 — 2026-05-09

### Added — Multi-agent architecture with Hermes kanban

**Agents** (`agents/` → installed to `~/.hermes/agents/`)
- `cto.md` — CTO Agent: orchestrates all agents, monitors kanban, reports to founder
- `pm.md` — PM Agent: triages issues, writes tickets, prioritizes backlog
- `dev.md` — Dev Agent: implements tickets, chooses engine, creates PRs
- `qa.md` — QA Agent: reviews PRs, runs health checks, writes founder summaries
- `ops.md` — Ops Agent: deploys, monitors production every 15min, handles incidents

**Skills**
- `kanban-task` — creates/updates Hermes kanban cards at every stage; used by all agents
- `cto-status-report` — reads full kanban + health log, sends plain-English morning report

**Workflows**
- `cto-loop` (v2) — rewritten with full multi-agent architecture and kanban column flow

**install.sh**
- Now installs `agents/` to `~/.hermes/agents/` alongside skills and workflows

## 1.2.0 — 2026-05-09

### Added — Autonomous CTO loop

**Skills**
- `auto-issue-triage` — cron-triggered hourly triage: scores issues by impact, picks top priority, routes to implementation
- `review-github-pr` — self-reviews PR diff, runs build + health check on preview URL, writes plain-English founder summary
- `await-merge-approval` — sends PR summary to founder via chat platform, blocks until YES/NO, merges or feeds back into the loop

**Workflows**
- `cto-loop` — full autonomous CTO workflow: cron → triage → implement → PR → review → approval → ship

**README**
- Added "Autonomous CTO loop" section with real example of the founder Telegram experience

### Added

**Skills**
- `manage-github-issues` — triage, create, label, assign, and close GitHub issues via `gh` CLI
- `create-github-pr` — creates PR from feature branch with description drawn from Hermes memory

**Workflows**
- `github-ops` — full GitHub ops loop: triage issues → implement → PR → preview deploy → merge

### Changed

- All 13 existing skills rewritten with CSO-optimized descriptions (all start "Use when...")
- Descriptions now describe triggering conditions only — no workflow summaries
- All skills under 350 words for Hermes memory efficiency
